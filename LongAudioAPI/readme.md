# Long Audio API samples

The Azure Long Audio API is about to be depreacted. We strongly recommend you use the [Batch synthesis API (Preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/batch-synthesis) for long audio synthesis. Refer to [Migrate to batch synthesis API](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/migrate-to-batch-synthesis) for more information.

You can find the samples for the Batch synthesis API [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/samples/batch-synthesis).
