HTTP Samples for Pronunciation Assessment
=========================================

This folder contains samples of using HTTP REST Call for Microsoft Cognitive Services (formerly Project Oxford)
Pronunciation Assessment REST APIs. You can check the [introduction page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-to-text) for what pronunciation assessment is.

The samples
===========

Build the samples
----------------

1. First, you must obtain a Speech API subscription key by following instructions in [Microsoft Cognitive Services subscription](<https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/sign-up>).

2. You need to find the line with the string "SubscriptionKey" in the source files of
a particular language, and replace it with your subscription key for Speech.

Run the samples
--------------

Follow the requirements of your language, and run the sample accordingly. For an overview of all the parameters, please check [pronunciation assessment parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/rest-speech-to-text#pronunciation-assessment-parameters).
