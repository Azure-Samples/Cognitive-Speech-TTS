HTTP Samples for Text To Speech
===============================

This folder contains samples of using HTTP REST Call for Microsoft Cognitive Services (formerly Project Oxford)
Text To Speech REST APIs.

The samples
===========

Many languages are demonstrated, including Android, C#, Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby.

Build the samples
----------------

1. First, you must obtain a Speech API subscription key by following instructions in [Microsoft Cognitive Services subscription](<https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/sign-up>).

2. You need to find the line with the string "Your Client Secret goes here" in the source files of
a particular language, and replace it with your subscription key for Speech.

3. For Android sample, follow this instruction to find the string:
In Android Studio -\> "Project" panel -\> "Android" view, open file
    "app/res/values/strings.xml", and find the line
    "Please\_add\_the\_subscription\_key\_here;". Replace the
    "Please\_add\_the\_subscription\_key\_here" value with your subscription key
    string from the first step. If you cannot find the file "strings.xml", it is
    in folder "Sample\app\src\main\res\values\string.xml".

Run the samples
--------------

Follow the requirements of your language, and run the sample accordingly. Find endpoints, languages and names of the voices on [Language and region support for the Speech Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/language-support#text-to-speech).
