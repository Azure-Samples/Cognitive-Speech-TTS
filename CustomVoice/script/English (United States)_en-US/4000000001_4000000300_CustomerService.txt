4000000102	Sorry your payment failed.
4000000103	Could you please tell us more about the problem you’re facing? 
4000000104	May I provide assistance in helping you decide?
4000000105	For how long have you been troubled by this?

4000000115	Feel free to let us know if you need any help during your order.
4000000116	It's been a while since you've last checked your shopping cart.
4000000117	Are you ready to check out, or can we help you browse our selection?
4000000118	It looks like you've been inactive for a while.
4000000119	Can we help you find anything?
4000000120	Could you please confirm your order ID?
4000000121	Do you need help locating something?
4000000122	It seems like you've been inactive for a few minutes.
4000000123	I feel bad to hear you have had to face this problem. 
4000000124	Could you elaborate a bit more so that I can know it better?
4000000125	Please feel free to use our live chat service if you have any questions.

4000000148	If you'd like to hear all of your shipping options, we can list them.
4000000149	However, I am not the right person to help with that. 
4000000150	Let me connect you to the department specialized for such matters.
4000000151	I now need to take your case to the senior representative. 
4000000152	We can get it done by today.
4000000153	I will take it from here. 
4000000154	Please feel free to contact us again if you have any more problems.

4000000163	It's been a while since your last response.
4000000164	Please respond within the next few minutes or this chat will be ended.
4000000165	Try moving closer to your router to better connectivity.
4000000166	Hello, it seems that you are away.
4000000167	May I put on hold till that time?
4000000168	If you still need my help, you can request a chat again.
4000000169	If servers are busy then there might be a slight delay.

4000000187	I will get back to you as soon as possible.
4000000188	Thanks for getting in touch!
4000000189	I actually created a tutorial for the exact issue you described.
4000000190	If that doesn't help resolve your issue, please feel free to contact me again.
4000000191	Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
4000000192	I'm always happy to help.
4000000193	I understand how upsetting this must be.
4000000194	I'm going to do everything I can to fix the problem for you.
4000000195	I really hope that helps.
4000000196	We hope you had a satisfactory experience with us today.
4000000197	We look forward to working with you in the future.
4000000198	I can certainly take care of that for you.
4000000199	Could you please hold on there for a few seconds? 
4000000200	May I suggest this instead?
4000000201	I understand your request. 
4000000202	The XYZ team is better handled to help you with that. 
4000000203	I've done the same thing myself before, so I can definitely relate.
4000000204	I'm truly sorry about that.
4000000205	It looks like you're purchasing an incompatible accessory.
4000000206	We're sorry, but that promotion is over.
4000000207	Morning, Chris speaking, how may I help you? 
4000000208	Call me if you need me to bring over something else.
4000000209	Will you be picking up in-store or shall we ship it to you?
4000000210	Would you mind being put on hold in the for a while?
4000000211	You should call the shipping line since it’s only updated on the web.
4000000212	Let me give you the container number here.
4000000213	We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to you due to that. 
4000000214	It is actually confined to ship.
4000000215	Ok just one moment here. 
4000000216	Perfect, then let me contact them. 
4000000217	I am sorry to hear about that. 
4000000218	You should not have had to go through it.
4000000219	I’m just checking the status of a billing, please.
4000000220	Ok, what's the billing number?
4000000221	We feel bad for the unpleasant experience you had to go through. 
4000000222	We’re sorry and we can confirm the earliest solution to your problem.
4000000223	Thanks for buying from us! 
4000000224	I also cleared an issue, should be available for pick up then.
4000000225	Oh, how many days of free time?
4000000226	Let us fix the issue immediately.  
4000000227	Your free trial will expire tomorrow.
4000000228	We hope you’re having a good time with our product.
4000000229	How has been your experience with our product? 
4000000230	You may need to refresh the page to see the new updates.
4000000231	We will contact you again soon later.
4000000232	If any issue, we’re just a call away.
4000000233	I hope you’re not facing the same issue again. 
4000000234	I see, so the charges would technically start on the fourth.
4000000235	Hit the refresh button and see if the form pops up.
4000000236	If you ever come across this problem, feel free to reach out to us.
4000000237	I can completely understand why you’re so upset. 
4000000238	Hey Chris, how are you doing? 
4000000239	I can assure you, such issues won't be repeated ever again.
4000000240	Good morning, I’m Christina, may I help you?
4000000241	Do you want me to call you back? 
4000000242	I’m hoping you can call me back.
4000000243	Okay no problem, I will call you back. 
4000000244	Select "debug" from the options list.
4000000245	Good afternoon, Kristy here, how can I help you?
4000000246	I want to see the status of a container. 
4000000247	Can I get the number please?
4000000248	You’re a valuable customer to us and your frustration is completely valid. 
4000000249	Ok, one moment please while I pull it up. 
4000000250	Anyone in your place would feel the same. 
4000000251	Can you pull an internal report for me?
4000000252	Fill out a crash report and our technicians will get back to you shortly.
4000000253	Can you please check the system again and make sure it is the correct container?
4000000254	Try and see if you can move your cursor now.
4000000255	Can you help me check my list of charges, please?
4000000256	I assure you a quick resolution to the problem.
4000000257	So, after those days it goes up?
4000000258	Huge thanks for using our product for this long.
4000000259	You can add this class to your schedule for an additional charge.
4000000260	Let me know when you get prompted by the download wizard. 
4000000261	How about we put a freeze on your account? 
4000000262	Is there anything else I can do for you?
4000000263	No, that's all, thank you. 
4000000264	Ok, thank you, have a nice day, bye-bye. 
4000000265	Our best guys are already on it. 
4000000266	We need to get an invoice for the charge made in March.
4000000267	Can you send me the billing number for the container?
4000000268	It just depends on how many my warehouse can take. 
4000000269	How many containers will you pick up today?
4000000270	I can do one right now but I think both need to be picked up. 
4000000271	If the items are released then the charges are guaranteed. 
4000000272	If there anyway I can take up the containers tomorrow.
4000000273	Ok, sure, let me just email you.
4000000274	Yes, that’s why I’m trying to get this information.
4000000275	Yes, no problem, just send us the message.
4000000276	I will also need the proof of release when I pick up the containers.
4000000277	Okay, no problem, I will just send you the invoice.
4000000278	Hi, how are you doing?
4000000279	Make sure you select the enterprise version of the software.
4000000280	You can't pause the download.
4000000281	I got a call from you that’s why I called you back. 
4000000282	Would you like an invoice?
4000000283	We will provide you with the invoice.
4000000284	It is probably the wrong number, then.
4000000285	We don’t support your device at the moment.
4000000286	Once we get everything up and running, we will get back to you.
4000000287	I am your personal customer care manager.
4000000288	Oh, they gave the wrong number then, sorry. 
4000000289	Unplug the computer if your screen freezes.
4000000290	Good afternoon, who am I speaking to? 
4000000291	I did a real billing on your website. 
4000000292	I’ll give you a direct phone number for the real billing department.
4000000293	Ok, that would be great!
4000000294	Why don’t you take our valid coupon?
4000000295	Make sure there aren't any other devices connected on the network.
4000000296	Are there any exports remaining at all?
4000000297	Let me get my team on it.
4000000298	How long is the wait time?
4000000299	You made a wise choice contacting our support. 
4000000300	Ok, I will keep waiting, then.
