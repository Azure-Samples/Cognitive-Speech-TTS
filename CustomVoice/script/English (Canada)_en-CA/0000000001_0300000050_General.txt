0000000001	Having complete focus on a recipe, and not allowing yourself to be distracted by your thoughts, can have a therapeutic effect.
0000000002	Baking is very good for focusing the mind because it often relies on very exact measurements. 
0000000003	But we can eat in the summer on the balcony and in the winter in the living room.
0000000004	I got the habit of visiting the church cemetery from my father, and of reading the newspaper, too.
0000000005	The monkey climbed up the tree and looked down at the river and the lake every day.
0000000006	And after that, the monkey climbed down from the tree and went to the riverside. 
0000000007	You say that you are rich and then you say that you do not want to draw the attention to yourself.
0000000008	This blueberry coffee cake is my go-to recipe for all of our holiday get-togethers, because it's perfect for breakfast or dessert.
0000000009	While the oil heats, dredge the chops in the flour, batting off any extra, then in the egg, then in the bread crumbs.
0000000010	I'm telling you, the charming, graceful sick person is just a myth, an urban legend.
0000000011	This was matched by a dive downward by bassoons, bass clarinet, trombones and bass tuba.
0000000012	They helped finish off his birthday cake, while his other family enjoyed a cake too.
0000000013	The development is set to transform an old industrial site into an interconnected smart city. 
0000000014	Reasonably priced salads, crepes, fresh fish and a large selection of ice cream are served.
0000000015	The two reservoirs fed by the Colorado River watershed, provide a critical supply of drinking water and irrigation for many across the region, including rural farms, ranches and native communities.
0000000016	Okay, but I want the furniture in the living room to be yellow and dark blue.
0000000017	This will be the fourth summer with a suite of restrictions on fisheries, tour boats and ships, in efforts to minimize these threats.
0000000018	First, she told each of them how they had made a difference to her and the class.
0000000019	He would rather sit and read the paper and drink a cup of coffee.
0000000020	Afterwards, the teacher decided to do a class project to see what kind of impact the recognition would have on a community.
0000000021	He was just a guy who saw a dirty girl on the street who needed to eat.
0000000022	Last Thursday, wildlife care specialists noticed the snow leopard had a cough and nasal discharge, the zoo said in a new release.
0000000023	I decided on my light jacket, pulled it on, and leashed up my bigger dog, Fluffy, to walk first.
0000000024	The snow leopard appears to be doing well and is showing no additional symptoms, the zoo said.
0000000025	She wishes she can run into the "business man" who bought her lunches, and say something.
0000000026	You only think about the earth, but you should also consider the sky and the sea. 
0000000027	It is the water that is the basis of life and drawn up by the clouds from the deep sea.
0000000028	Every week my father would call the boy and get a "generic" answering-machine message.
0000000029	It is so nice that every time you look at a sunflower, the whole world starts to smile.
0000000030	I may be scarce, but I am precious for I serve the needs of human life. 
0000000031	Red is the colour of passion and of love, the red rose, the poinsettia and the poppy.
0000000032	When they had all gone and come back, he called them together to describe what they had seen.
0000000033	People love it, as it was laden with blossoms that smelled so sweet and looked so beautiful.
0000000034	I truly witnessed a love that brought me to tears when I got home from work last night.
0000000035	Only by forgetting can you walk towards the kind of life that you want with lighter steps.
0000000036	At one point, the elderly couple signaled to me that they were ready to order the meal.
0000000037	When I was younger, I always knew my parents were working hard for the family.
0000000038	As I told him my name was Angela, my mom handed me the soup ladle and hair net to start getting to work.
0000000039	A familiar man called me back saying he thought I left something in our mailbox.
0000000040	I reached in and pulled out a huge manila envelope that was bulky, but I couldn't tell what was in it.
0000000041	She opened the first red box, then she found our first super expensive rent bill.
0000000042	As well as dwellings, the proposal would also introduce comprehensive planting to strengthen all boundaries, and ensure the next generation of mature trees and hedgerows, will flourish on the site.
0000000043	I had a feeling I knew who had sent it, but didn't want to tell my mom.
0000000044	It was still dark outside, so I felt my way to the wall switch and turned on the light.
0000000045	I got dressed quickly because I knew both of my dogs would be eager to get outside for their morning walk.
0000000046	Oh, it had been cold and snowy two days ago, and warm and rainy yesterday.
0000000047	I had forgotten to check the weather report for today, however, so I wasn't sure if I needed my light jacket or my heavy coat.
0000000048	I can still remember gazing endlessly at the photographs of granite peaks, roaring waterfalls and magnificent wildlife, and daydreaming about wandering in those landscapes.
0000000049	A single serving of whole grains is one slice of whole-grain bread, or a half cup of oats, or a half cup of brown rice.
0000000050	Eating the whole grain, as our ancestors used to do, provides a host of benefits to the body that are lost when the grain is processed.
0000000051	While my dog sniffed the ground, I opened my heart to the wonder of Nature's creation.
0000000052	In all of its sweet seasons here, it had never failed to touch my soul.
0000000053	The flour in white breads, bagels, pastries and pasta has lost the grain's fibre-rich outer layer during the refining process. 
0000000054	It had heated my heart on the coldest days and lighted my spirit on the darkest nights.
0000000055	Then I thanked Nature for the love that created the moon, the stars, and me.
0000000056	I don't often eat lunch at work, and tend to just work through the day and eat dinner when I get home.
0000000057	I was having a bad day, it was around four P M and I was struggling to make things happen.
0000000058	Gave my twenty-eight-year-old self a snack and a juice box and it was the most caring thing I've ever had a boss do.
0000000059	One day my little dog Milo escaped the fenced yard of a friend in Vancouver and ran off.
0000000060	Yellowstone National Park also serves as a time capsule, a sort of 'land that time forgot' in terms of wildlife.
0000000061	Small incremental changes in your diet to increase whole-grain intake will make a difference over time.
0000000062	They waited for me in a grocery store parking lot until I came to pick him up.
0000000063	As we know, men often discover their affinity to each other by the mutual love.
0000000064	The book he gave me was really interesting despite the strange title it had.
0000000065	Here is another reason to get serious about saving – it is a new year.
0000000066	In addition to enjoying them raw and cooked in desserts, fresh peaches can be roasted, pickled, and even frozen for a burst of summer sunshine in the middle of winter.
0000000067	Although the occasion isn't going to turn us into smart savers, it sure is a good reminder. 
0000000068	We all have our own methods of dealing with money, but here are a couple of saving tricks that will grow your money.
0000000069	Here's how you can maximize your peach perfection with recipe ideas for breakfast, lunch, dinner – and dessert, of course.
0000000070	Time is of no account with great thoughts, which are as fresh today as when they first passed through their author’s minds, ages ago. 
0000000071	Overnight oats are a trend that's not going away anytime soon, and summer is the ideal time to embrace this chilled-out breakfast dish. 
0000000072	Books introduce us into the best society, they bring us into the presence of the greatest minds that have ever lived. 
0000000073	You can experiment with these grains by incorporating them in small amounts into your morning bowl of oatmeal.
0000000074	The Park has been a global leader in establishing the range of possibilities and approaches to caring for wild animals and landscapes.
0000000075	Add fresh sliced peaches to a mason jar with oats, milk and spices, and you've got a sweet peach cobbler-inspired treat waiting for you in the morning.
0000000076	Fire up the grill, and give your peaches a little heat, to turn them into a sweetly charred accompaniment for a number of dishes.
0000000077	It's hard to deny that tomatoes are the ideal summer food – and that's saying a lot in a season where so much produce is at its peak.
0000000078	The place is quite remote and is perfect for a relaxed swim before going for your meal.
0000000079	To grill peaches, preheat a gas or charcoal grill to medium heat, halve and pit the peaches, then brush the cut halves with olive oil or vegetable oil.
0000000080	Their experience becomes ours, and we feel as if we were, in a measure, actors with them in the scenes which they describe.
0000000081	The paste adds umami, while coriander powder gives it an earthy lift, which balances the heaviness of the pork belly.
0000000082	It's a place where you see Earth for what it has come to be over the course of millions of years, not for the things we've done to it. 
0000000083	They kept on walking until they found an oasis, where they decided to take a bath.
0000000084	Grilled peaches become the star of the show in a big salad, like this quinoa, peach and summer vegetable salad that works as a main course. 
0000000085	One way to increase your chances of getting a lower rate, is to come prepared with information on other card offers that you have seen available, he said. 
0000000086	Consuming fresh tomatoes with a source of fat, such as olive oil, is a great way to boost lycopene absorption, she said.
0000000087	But even this description is an understatement – the otherworldly nature of the area simply evokes awe.
0000000088	When it comes down to it, almost anything can be a salad or a sandwich – the potential combinations are endless. 
0000000089	And if you want to pile on more ingredients, you'll find ways to make a tomato sandwich every day of the week.
0000000090	I once saw nine different grizzly bears in one day and had almost forty bighorn sheep wander with me one day as I ate my lunch.
0000000091	Or simply drizzle them with balsamic vinegar and quality olive oil along with a sprinkling of flaky sea salt and serve as a fruit salad.
0000000092	What was then said and thought still speaks to us as vividly as ever from the printed page. 
0000000093	The only effect of time has been to sift out the bad products, for nothing in literature can long survive but what is really good.
0000000094	There is no sandy beach, but if you like rocks and deep waters, it is the perfect place.
0000000095	Turn it into the base for a Cobb salad with as many tomatoes and leftover fridge elements as you can handle. 
0000000096	It's worthwhile mentioning that just a few hundred metres away there is an access to the sea.
0000000097	Try this recipe as a start, and pick and choose add-ins like roasted red peppers and marinated chickpeas to suit your tastes.
0000000098	We also recommend the grilled choices where you get a variety of fresh meat and fish dishes.
0000000099	Instead, stir up a no-cook tomato sauce that practically explodes with the juiciness of fresh tomatoes.
0000000100	The dish is topped with crushed red and green chili, and you can heap it over rice, or scoop it all up with a buttered baguette.
0000000101	As a restaurant owner I knew this thing was gold the moment I saw it. 
0000000102	The chef is the mother of the family, and the majority of the ingredients used for the dishes are produced by the same family.
0000000103	But it is very important to understand the fees, what the rate will be after the low-rate period ends and if there are any deadlines with balance transfer cards.
0000000104	And that means going beyond benefits like vacation days and retirement plans, and considering things like the company's culture, manager expectations, job satisfaction and development, and work-life balance.
0000000105	If being able to work from home is important to you, it's good to get a sense of a company's flexibility before getting too far along in the interview process.
0000000106	Lee says he steams his rolls the day before, and leaves them in the fridge to rest, so that they are crispier and browner when he fries them.
0000000107	It is perfect for families since the kids can safely run around and play in the garden.
0000000108	If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen and fire up the grill.

0000000110	Foil packet meals are quite possibly the easiest way to grill with very little mess and clean-up.
0000000111	Place salmon fillets on a piece of heavy-duty foil drizzled with olive oil and load them up with halved cherry tomatoes and herbs like rosemary, dill or cilantro.
0000000112	This method is infinitely versatile – so if you're craving other seafood, like shrimp or scallops, or more summer vegetables, you can customize it to each family member's tastes.
0000000113	Surrounded by olive groves and a beautiful garden, it is the perfect place to relax and enjoy a beautiful dinner or lunch.
0000000114	If chips and salsa are all you have an appetite for, make homemade salsa by charring whole tomatoes, peppers and onions on the grill.

0000000118	For children wanting to ride, depending on their age, the schools can provide a suitable horse. 
0000000119	Tomato water is nothing more than the slowly – very slowly – strained liquid from a tomato, and it's a low-maintenance way to make stellar drinks.
0000000120	Line a metal strainer with a flour sack towel or cheesecloth, then place it over a deep bowl.
0000000121	Treks usually consist of groups of no more than six people and are accompanied by an experienced instructor.

0000000124	The route goes through the Peripheral Zone and Protected Landscape areas of the park, as well as a forest of medieval olive groves at K Beach.
0000000125	Regardless of your familiarity with the sport, you can combine your holiday with a spot of  horse-riding. 
0000000126	You can either go on a simple stroll with a horse, or if you would like to spend more time horse-riding, you can take lessons.
0000000127	For beginners you begin by learning some theory first, this includes safety, codes of communication and getting to know the horse.
0000000128	This is then continued with the practical part of getting on the horse and then moving. 
0000000129	Most schools provide free equipment and transportation to and from their place of residence along with insurance. 
0000000130	The dishes are suitable for even the choosiest of palettes, not forgetting the specialties of local chicken and rabbit stew.
0000000131	The wine cellar consists of a range of nice local wines and many fine labels.
0000000132	Good food is well accompanied by a range of desserts that are sure to impress.
0000000133	Spinach joins these, with the greatest benefits derived from these vegetables in their raw or lightly cooked form.
0000000134	They invite you to try them with rich sauces and fresh vegetables, and main dishes that will delight.
0000000135	Even with all its potential, Popeye's favourite food does have a few downsides, especially raw spinach, can lend some people a, well, gassy air.

0000000137	The tickets are paperless, and passengers can use the updated season ticket calculator on the National Rail website, to find out the best ticket for their route and travel patterns.
0000000138	If you're concerned about getting enough calcium in your system, it may be well to leave spinach out of the cheesy lasagnas in which it is so often deployed. 
0000000139	In a building of traditional architecture and surrounded by pine trees is the restaurant "O Babis".
0000000140	But tonight, a car stopped at his house, and a policeman helped him get out. 
0000000141	On Sunday morning Donny went into the yard and played football with a dog.
0000000142	Sometimes a bird would come down to stay on the top of the dog’s house.
0000000143	Lightly sautéing fresh spinach in a drizzle of olive or avocado oil meets this baseline, and it's tasty and nutritious as well.
0000000144	Another option is to wash spinach and other leafy greens thoroughly in running water before eating them.
0000000145	A little panda picks up a pumpkin and wants to take it home to share with family. 
0000000146	In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, rice wine, vinegar, sesame oil, garlic, five-spice powder and sugar. 
0000000147	She can eat the fish, but she puts the fish into the river and goes on fishing.
0000000148	She climbed up a tree and held the younger one in her arms for safety.
0000000149	There are many cute animals in the forest, because today is a nice sunny day. 
0000000150	A woman with a red dress walks into a pet shop and sees a cute little dog. 
0000000151	The significance of the dwindling supply in both reservoirs cannot be overstated.
0000000152	Sometime after, the fishermen left the net and went to have lunch. 
0000000153	The pumpkin is too big. 
0000000154	The panda can’t take it home.
0000000155	This simultaneous Home Movies posting is at an end.
0000000156	Suddenly she sees a bear riding a bike toward her.
0000000157	He likes walking in the street. 
0000000158	And he goes to bed at seven o’clock.
0000000159	The old man smiles like a child.
0000000160	The monkey was planning to throw the net like the fishermen did.
0000000161	The monkey was confident since he was good at imitating. 
0000000162	As evening approaches, tennis, volleyball, and softball get going.
0000000163	He thinks the sky is as big as the mouth of the well.
0000000164	One day a crow comes to the well. 
0000000165	So the frog comes out from the well.
0000000166	It was much more about zero waste and being sustainable.
0000000167	This is, however, accompanied by a lack of fast twitch fibres.
0000000168	Saves you so much time.
0000000169	It’s a sunny day in spring.
0000000170	An ox and a dog serve for the same farmer.
0000000171	After that, their relationship became known.
0000000172	The monkey mother has two little monkeys. 
0000000173	Gatorade has Alpine Snow, Riptide Rush, and Glacier Freeze.
0000000174	They returned home in a hurry and shouted.
0000000175	You have to add ingredients in the correct order. 
0000000176	Once upon a time, there lived a monkey in the woods. 
0000000177	He watched how the fishermen caught fish.
0000000178	Tied up in the net, the monkey fell into the water.
0000000179	My father had such a good personality.
0000000180	He was the horse-keeper of a funeral carriage.
0000000181	He was from a good family of high class. 
0000000182	He spent his life enjoying everyday.

0000000187	Animals are having a sports meeting.
0000000188	A tiger is hungry, he is looking for food. 
0000000189	He sees a frog in front of him.
0000000190	You'd be surprised at just how outrageous or outlandish some of the claims are.
0000000191	Behind the tiger, there is a tortoise.
0000000192	The little tortoise sees it, he bites the tiger’s tail.
0000000193	The tortoise and the frog swim away together.
0000000194	The giraffes are quite tall because of their long necks. 
0000000195	There are many kinds of animals in the world. 
0000000196	People don’t know the exact numbers.
0000000197	Last night I wanted doughnuts.
0000000198	There are beautiful vistas, secluded villages, and a range of exhilarating walks en route.
0000000199	They have a long neck so they can reach the top of the trees.
0000000200	They unsuccessfully tried to stonewall the move.
0000000201	Firstly, it easily fit any pot or bowl we put it in.
0000000202	He would let her get anything in the menu.
0000000203	There was never any conversation.
0000000204	All aboard the platform have been evacuated.
0000000205	The tourists were astonished by the sheer size of the statue. 
0000000206	I work as a waiter at a hotel.
0000000207	The dogs tried everything to get the cat to move.
0000000208	We usually do our own tables.
0000000209	Their goal, however, appears more basic, some semblance of equal representation.
0000000210	It took a while for him to order.
0000000211	The community banded together in support of the family.
0000000212	Supplies are very limited, you ought to purchase soon.
0000000213	She never felt like a project to him.
0000000214	She never felt less than him.
0000000215	She has earned her MBA with honours.
0000000216	Second, unlike strict hierarchies, a child term may have more than one parent terms.
0000000217	She is an amazing woman and an amazing mother.
0000000218	The sky gives space and peace and serenity.
0000000219	There was a man who had four sons.
0000000220	She used beets in the soup to give it more flavour.
0000000221	But if the back door is closed, defended, keep passing.
0000000222	The ants enjoyed the barbecue more than the family.
0000000223	She was sitting there and she looked so proud.
0000000224	In our view, clarifying these issues is of considerable importance.
0000000225	He wanted his sons to learn to not judge things too quickly.
0000000226	At first glance it doesn’t look like much. 
0000000227	The toy is on the floor.
0000000228	Don't judge a life by one difficult season.
0000000229	Gaze out to sea, picnic on benches and watch fishermen hook herring.
0000000230	I turned my head up to the sky.
0000000231	He's a gastroenterologist, and she's a chef.
0000000232	My wife was homeless as a teenager.
0000000233	He was just some dude offering her a meal.
0000000234	A handle and three weird-looking legs.
0000000235	Beginning in the late preschool years, children can learn to program.
0000000236	My boss, a wonderful lady, saw this.
0000000237	She hands me a bag of grapes she had left from lunch.
0000000238	The cat looks at the fish.
0000000239	The car swept past the green pastures.
0000000240	Mind you, it was no easy task. 
0000000241	The boy puts on his socks.
0000000242	The floodgates were opened to release the stormwater downstream.
0000000243	Yet, the net wound around the monkey when he touched it.
0000000244	We suspect he ran away after the Fourth fireworks.
0000000245	He was running in and out of traffic on the freeway.
0000000246	He walks to the front door.
0000000247	A good book may be among the best of friends.
0000000248	I'm starving, even though I've eaten dinner.
0000000249	Temples and statues decay, but books survive. 
0000000250	Its biggest imports are unassembled auto parts, computers and machinery.
0000000251	The cat walks over to the chair.
0000000252	I am moved to offer some armchair psychological analysis.
