# Microsoft Speech Service API: Text-to-Speech Samples
This repo contains sample in various languages for using Text-to-Speech.
[Speech Service](<https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/directory/speech/>) is generally avaliable since [2018.9](<https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/azure-cognitive-services-speech-service-is-now-generally-available/>). Please be sure you have a subscription key for the new Speech Service, not a subcription key from the retiring Bing Speech. 

Microsoft also offers [Neural TTS preview](<https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-s-new-neural-text-to-speech-service-helps-machines-speak-like-people/>) which can be invoked following the samples in this repo as well. What you need is to use a neural TTS endpoint.  

Recommend to run the CSharp example first which is always kept up to date.
