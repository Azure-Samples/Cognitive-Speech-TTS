# Microsoft Speech Service API: Text-to-Speech Samples

Microsoft Text to speech service now is offically supported by [Speech SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-sdk) now.  It is recommended way to use TTS in your service or apps.  It supports both REST and Websocket connection to the service. This repo still contains sample in various languages for using Text-to-Speech.  We will also support the common development questions using the issues tracker.  

Recommend to run the CSharp example first which is always kept up to date.
