Custom Voice API
===============================

This folder contains samples of using HTTP REST Call for Microsoft Custom Voice REST APIs.

The samples
===========

Use API to construct an e2e flow: upload data, start modeling, create voice test, create endpoint and so on.

Build the samples
----------------

1. First, you must obtain a Speech API subscription key by following instructions in [Microsoft Cognitive Services subscription](<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/rest-apis#authentication>).

2. You need to replace the endpoint, ibizaStsUrl and SubscriptionKey in the Program.cs file based on the information of the Region and your subscription key.
